# Algorithm: Convolution Neural Network Using Transfer Learning In Keras ( Tensorflow Backend)

## Loss Function = 0.2309
## Accuracy = 94.27%
## Epochs = 5
The number of epochs is a hyperparameter that defines the number times that the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset

## Loss Function used here is Categorical crossentropy
Categorical crossentropy is a loss function that is used for single label categorization. 
This is when only one category is applicable for each data point. In other words, an example can belong to one class only.

## To run this code in your PC you need jupyter notebook.

Installing Jupyter using Anaconda and conda.

For new users, we highly recommend installing Anaconda. Anaconda conveniently installs Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science.

Use the following installation steps:

Download Anaconda. We recommend downloading Anacondaâ€™s latest Python 3 version (currently Python 3.7).
Install the version of Anaconda which you downloaded, following the instructions on the download page.
Congratulations, you have installed Jupyter Notebook. To run the notebook:

cmd: jupyter notebook
